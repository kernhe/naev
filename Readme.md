# NAEV README

![Naev Logo](https://naev.org/imgs/naev.png)

Naev is a 2D space trading and combat game, taking inspiration from the [Escape
Velocity series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_Velocity_(video_game)), among others.

You pilot a space ship from a top-down perspective, and are more or less free
to do what you want. As the genre name implies, you’re able to trade and engage
in combat at will. Beyond that, there’s an ever-growing number of storyline
missions, equipment, and ships; Even the galaxy itself grows larger with each
release. For the literarily-inclined, there are large amounts of lore
accompanying everything from planets to equipment.

## DEPENDENCIES

Naev's dependencies are intended to be relatively common. In addition to
an OpenGL-capable graphics card and driver, Naev requires the following:
* SDL 2
* libxml2
* freetype2
* libpng
* OpenAL
* libvorbis
* binutils
* intltool

If you're cross-compiling for Windows, you must install this soft dependency:
* [physfs](https://icculus.org/physfs/), example package name mingw-w64-physfs


### Ubuntu
Install compile-time dependencies on Ubuntu 20.04 (and hopefully later) with:

```
apt-get install build-essential libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev \
libgl1-mesa-dev libxml2-dev libfreetype6-dev libpng-dev libopenal-dev \
libvorbis-dev binutils-dev libiberty-dev autopoint intltool libfontconfig-dev \
libphysfs-dev libsuitesparse-dev python3-pip
pip3 install meson ninja
```

We do not suggest to build on Ubuntu releases < 20.04, as they do not provide the up-to-date releases 
of the dependencies. Sorry.

### macOS

Warning: this procedure is inadequate if you want to build a Naev.app that you can share with users of older macOS versions than your own.

Dependencies may be installed using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):
```
brew install freetype gettext intltool libpng libvorbis luajit meson openal-soft physfs pkg-config sdl2_image suite-sparse
```
Building the latest available code in git is recommended, but to build version 0.8 you can add `sdl2_mixer` (and `autoconf-archive` and `automake` if using Autotools to build).

Meson needs an extra argument to find Homebrew's `openal-soft` package: `--pkg-config-path=/usr/local/opt/openal-soft/lib/pkgconfig`.
If build may fail if `suite-sparse` is installed via Homebrew, citing an undefined reference to `_cs_di_spfree`. A workaround is to pass `--force-fallback-for=SuiteSparse`.
(These arguments may be passed to the initial `meson setup` or applied later using `meson configure`. For 0.8/Autotools, set the `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable before running `./configure`.)

### Other \*nix

See [here](https://github.com/naev/naev/wiki/Compiling-on-*nix) for package lists for several
distributions.

## COMPILING

Run:

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
meson setup builddir .
cd builddir
meson compile
meson compile naev-gmo  # To make non-English translations available
./naev.sh
```

If you need special settings you can run `meson configure` in your build
directory to see a list of all available options.

## INSTALLATION

Naev currently supports `meson install` which will install everything that
is needed.

If you wish to create a .desktop for your desktop environment, logos
from 16x16 to 256x256 can be found in `extras/logos/`.

## WINDOWS

See https://github.com/naev/naev/wiki/Compiling-on-Windows for how to compile on windows.

## UPDATING ART ASSETS

Art assets are partially stored in the naev-artwork-production repository and
sometimes are updated. For that reason, it is recommended to periodically
update the submodules with the following command.

```bash
git submodule update
```

## UPDATING PO FILES

If you are a developer, you may need to update translation files as
text is modified. You can update all translation files with the
following commands:

```bash
meson compile potfiles # only necessary if files have been added or removed
meson compile naev-pot
meson compile naev-update-po
```

Again, you will only ever need to do this if you are a developer.

## CRASHES & PROBLEMS

Please take a look at the [FAQ](https://github.com/naev/naev/wiki/FAQ) before submitting a new
bug report, as it covers a number of common gameplay questions and
common issues.

If Naev is crashing during gameplay, please file a bug report after
